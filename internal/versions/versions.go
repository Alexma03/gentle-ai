// Package versions centralizes pinned external package versions so Renovate can
// auto-PR bumps. The marker comments are machine-readable directives consumed
// by the customManager defined in renovate.json — keep them in the exact form
// `// renovate: datasource=<ds> depName=<name>` immediately above each const.
//
// Historical client pins were removed here:
// gentle-ai no longer installs agent runtimes on the user's behalf (see
// agentInstallStep in internal/cli/run.go), and the display-only refusal
// commands that used to read these pins now advise "latest" instead, since a
// human runs them and a frozen version goes stale as soon as a newer release
// ships.
